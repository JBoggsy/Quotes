## Quotes
    All that is gold does not glitter,
    Not all those who wander are lost;
    The old that is strong does not wither,
    Deep roots are not reached by the frost.

    A light from the shadows shall spring;
    Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
    The crownless again shall be king.
