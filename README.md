## About
This is just a repository of quotes I find memorable and interesting, a place to keep thought-provoking words I've heard or read throughout my life. I may sub-divided this into categories eventually, but for now it's just a list.

## Quotes
    All that is gold does not glitter,
    Not all those who wander are lost;
    The old that is strong does not wither,
    Deep roots are not reached by the frost.

    From the ashes, a fire shall be woken,
    A light from the shadows shall spring;
    Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
    The crownless again shall be king.
    
    Aragorn - The Fellowship of the Ring
    Given to me by my dear friend Gianluca Avanzato
